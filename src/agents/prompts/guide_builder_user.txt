Analyze this construction plan page to discover the visual conventions used in this project.

You MUST respond with a valid JSON object following this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "observations": [
    {{
      "id": "OBS_001",
      "category": "LINE_STYLE | SYMBOL | TEXT | HATCHING | COLOR | LAYOUT",
      "description": "Factual description of what you see",
      "location": "Where on the page",
      "confidence": "high | medium | low"
    }}
  ],
  "candidate_rules": [
    {{
      "id": "RULE_001",
      "description": "The rule statement",
      "based_on": ["OBS_001", "OBS_002"],
      "confidence": "high | medium | low"
    }}
  ],
  "uncertainties": [
    "List of things that are unclear or need validation"
  ],
  "assumptions": []
}}
```

CRITICAL RULES:
1. The "assumptions" array MUST be empty - you are not allowed to assume anything
2. Every observation must be something you can SEE, not infer
3. Do NOT assume standard meanings for any symbol
4. Each candidate_rule must reference specific observations in "based_on"
5. Mark confidence as "low" if you have any doubt

Categories to analyze:
- LINE_STYLE: Line weights, dashed/solid, patterns
- SYMBOL: Recurring graphical symbols and their context
- TEXT: Font sizes, label formats, dimension notation
- HATCHING: Fill patterns and what areas they mark
- COLOR: Colors used and apparent meaning
- LAYOUT: Information organization, headers, scale notation

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no other text.

ROOM LABELS (Phase 3.3) — MANDATORY EXTRACTION SPECIFICATION

Purpose: enable machine extraction of rooms. These observations are REQUIRED for Phase 3.3 extraction to work.

Task:
1. Actively search for room labels on the page (text inside enclosed spaces):
   - room names: text labels inside rooms (typically uppercase words)
   - room numbers: numeric tokens (2-4 digits), often near or below the name, sometimes boxed

2. If room labels are visible, you MUST produce ALL of the following observations:

   ROOM NAME observations (minimum 2):
   - OBS: "room_name_pattern_1" — describe the text format (uppercase, mixed case, etc.)
   - OBS: "room_name_pattern_2" — cite a second concrete example with exact text and location

   ROOM NUMBER observations (minimum 2, CRITICAL for extraction):
   - OBS: "room_number_pattern_1" — describe the numeric format (e.g. "3-digit numbers like 203, 204")
   - OBS: "room_number_pattern_2" — specify if numbers are BOXED (inside a rectangle/frame) or UNBOXED
   - Include at least 2 concrete examples of room numbers you see on the page

   SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP observation (minimum 1):
   - OBS: "room_label_spatial_relationship" — describe the dominant position of room_number relative to room_name
   - Example: "room number appears BELOW the room name, centered, approximately 20-50 pixels apart"

3. You MUST produce these 3 candidate rules (these are REQUIRED for extraction):

   RULE: room_name_token_pattern (REQUIRED)
   - id: use format "RULE_0XX_ROOM_NAME"
   - description: "Room names are [describe pattern observed]"
   - based_on: reference your room_name observations
   - confidence: medium or high (NOT low — if you see room names, report them)

   RULE: room_number_token_pattern (REQUIRED)
   - id: use format "RULE_0XX_ROOM_NUMBER"
   - description: "Room numbers are [2-4 digit numbers], [boxed/unboxed], placed [location relative to name]"
   - based_on: reference your room_number observations
   - confidence: medium or high (NOT low — if you see room numbers, report them)

   RULE: room_name_number_pairing (REQUIRED)
   - id: use format "RULE_0XX_ROOM_PAIRING"
   - description: "Room number is positioned [below/above/right/left] the room name, within approximately [N] pixels"
   - based_on: reference your spatial relationship observation
   - confidence: medium or high

4. If NO room labels are visible on the page:
   - Add observation: "NO_ROOM_LABELS_FOUND" with clear explanation
   - Do NOT invent room labels

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT use hardcoded word lists (no CLASSE, CORRIDOR, BUREAU, etc.)
- Use ONLY visual and textual patterns you observe on THIS page
- Examples MUST come from what you see, not general knowledge
- These 3 rules are REQUIRED for extraction — do not omit them if room labels exist
