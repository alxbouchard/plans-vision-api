Analyze this construction plan page to discover the visual conventions used in this project.

For each visual element you observe, identify:

1. LINE STYLES
   - Different line weights and what they might distinguish
   - Dashed vs solid lines and their apparent meanings
   - Any special line patterns you observe

2. SYMBOLS AND MARKERS
   - Recurring graphical symbols
   - What context they appear in
   - Do NOT assume standard meanings - describe what you SEE

3. TEXT AND ANNOTATIONS
   - Font sizes and their apparent hierarchy
   - Label formats and patterns
   - Dimension notation style

4. HATCHING AND FILLS
   - Different fill patterns observed
   - What areas they are applied to
   - Apparent distinctions they create

5. COLOR USAGE (if applicable)
   - Colors used and where
   - Apparent meaning based on context

6. LAYOUT CONVENTIONS
   - How information is organized
   - Header/footer patterns
   - Scale notation

For each convention, provide:
- DESCRIPTION: What you observe
- CONTEXT: Where/how it appears
- CONFIDENCE: High/Medium/Low based on clarity
- EVIDENCE: Specific examples from this page

Format your response as a structured visual guide that another analyst could use.
Mark any uncertainties explicitly - these will be validated against other pages.
