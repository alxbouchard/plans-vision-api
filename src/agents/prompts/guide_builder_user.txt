Analyze this construction plan page to discover the visual conventions used in this project.

You MUST respond with a valid JSON object following this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "observations": [
    {{
      "id": "OBS_001",
      "category": "LINE_STYLE | SYMBOL | TEXT | HATCHING | COLOR | LAYOUT",
      "description": "Factual description of what you see",
      "location": "Where on the page",
      "confidence": "high | medium | low"
    }}
  ],
  "candidate_rules": [
    {{
      "id": "RULE_001",
      "description": "The rule statement",
      "based_on": ["OBS_001", "OBS_002"],
      "confidence": "high | medium | low"
    }}
  ],
  "uncertainties": [
    "List of things that are unclear or need validation"
  ],
  "assumptions": []
}}
```

CRITICAL RULES:
1. The "assumptions" array MUST be empty - you are not allowed to assume anything
2. Every observation must be something you can SEE, not infer
3. Do NOT assume standard meanings for any symbol
4. Each candidate_rule must reference specific observations in "based_on"
5. Mark confidence as "low" if you have any doubt

Categories to analyze:
- LINE_STYLE: Line weights, dashed/solid, patterns
- SYMBOL: Recurring graphical symbols and their context
- TEXT: Font sizes, label formats, dimension notation
- HATCHING: Fill patterns and what areas they mark
- COLOR: Colors used and apparent meaning
- LAYOUT: Information organization, headers, scale notation

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no other text.
