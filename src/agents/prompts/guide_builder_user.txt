Analyze this construction plan page to discover the visual conventions used in this project.

IMPORTANT: This analysis may be the ONLY page available. You must extract complete, actionable rules from this single page. Do not defer observations expecting "more pages later".

ROOM LABELS — MANDATORY EXTRACTION (Phase 3.4)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Purpose: Enable machine extraction of rooms from THIS PAGE ALONE.

STEP 1 — Search for room labels (text inside enclosed spaces):
- room names: text labels inside rooms (typically uppercase words)
- room numbers: numeric tokens (2-4 digits), often near or below the name

STEP 2 — If room labels are visible, you MUST produce these observations:

ROOM NAME observations (minimum 2):
- OBS_0XX: Describe the text format (uppercase, mixed case, font size)
- OBS_0XX: Cite concrete examples with EXACT text seen (e.g., "CLASSE", "CORRIDOR")

ROOM NUMBER observations (minimum 2, CRITICAL):
- OBS_0XX: Describe the numeric format (digit count, e.g., "3-digit numbers: 203, 204, 206")
- OBS_0XX: State if numbers are BOXED (framed) or UNBOXED (plain text)
- You MUST cite at least 2 concrete room numbers you see on the page

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP observation (minimum 1, CRITICAL):
- OBS_0XX: Describe WHERE room_number appears relative to room_name
- State the dominant pattern: "BELOW", "ABOVE", "RIGHT", or "LEFT"
- Estimate vertical/horizontal spacing if visible

STEP 3 — You MUST produce exactly 3 candidate rules for room extraction:

RULE_0XX_ROOM_NAME (REQUIRED):
- description: "Room names are [pattern observed]"
- based_on: reference your room_name observations
- confidence: "medium" or "high" (NEVER "low" if you see room names)

RULE_0XX_ROOM_NUMBER (REQUIRED):
- description: "Room numbers are [N]-digit numbers, [boxed/unboxed]"
- based_on: reference your room_number observations
- confidence: "medium" or "high" (NEVER "low" if you see room numbers)

RULE_0XX_ROOM_PAIRING (REQUIRED):
- description: "Room number is positioned [below/above/right/left] the room name, within [estimate] pixels"
- based_on: reference your spatial relationship observation
- confidence: "medium" or "high"

STEP 4 — If NO room labels are visible:
- Add observation with id containing "NO_ROOM_LABELS" and explain why
- Do NOT invent room labels

CONSTRAINTS (non-negotiable):
- Do NOT use hardcoded word lists (no CLASSE, CORRIDOR, BUREAU in rules)
- Use ONLY patterns you observe on THIS page
- Examples MUST be real text you see, not assumed
- All 3 rules are REQUIRED if room labels exist — omission causes extraction failure

GENERAL CATEGORIES TO ANALYZE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- LINE_STYLE: Line weights, dashed/solid, patterns
- SYMBOL: Recurring graphical symbols and their context
- TEXT: Font sizes, label formats, dimension notation
- HATCHING: Fill patterns and what areas they mark
- COLOR: Colors used and apparent meaning
- LAYOUT: Information organization, headers, scale notation

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT JSON
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You MUST respond with a valid JSON object following this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "observations": [
    {{
      "id": "OBS_001",
      "category": "LINE_STYLE | SYMBOL | TEXT | HATCHING | COLOR | LAYOUT",
      "description": "Factual description of what you see",
      "location": "Where on the page",
      "confidence": "high | medium | low"
    }}
  ],
  "candidate_rules": [
    {{
      "id": "RULE_001",
      "description": "The rule statement",
      "based_on": ["OBS_001", "OBS_002"],
      "confidence": "high | medium | low"
    }}
  ],
  "uncertainties": [
    "List of things that are unclear or need validation"
  ],
  "assumptions": []
}}
```

CRITICAL RULES:
1. The "assumptions" array MUST be empty — you are not allowed to assume anything
2. Every observation must be something you can SEE, not infer
3. Do NOT assume standard meanings for any symbol
4. Each candidate_rule must reference specific observations in "based_on"
5. Mark confidence as "low" only if genuinely uncertain

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no other text.
