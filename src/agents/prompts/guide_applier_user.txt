Test this provisional visual guide against page {page_number}.

PROVISIONAL GUIDE:
{provisional_guide}

You MUST respond with a valid JSON object following this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "page_number": 2,
  "rule_validations": [
    {{
      "rule_id": "RULE_001",
      "status": "confirmed | contradicted | not_testable | variation",
      "evidence": "Specific evidence from this page",
      "details": "Optional additional details"
    }}
  ],
  "new_observations": [
    {{
      "description": "New pattern not in the guide",
      "location": "Where on the page",
      "suggested_rule": "Optional suggested rule"
    }}
  ],
  "overall_consistency": "consistent | mostly_consistent | inconsistent"
}}
```

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Every rule in the guide MUST have a validation entry
2. Status MUST be exactly one of: confirmed, contradicted, not_testable, variation
3. "contradicted" means the rule is VIOLATED - not just absent
4. "not_testable" means the relevant elements don't appear on this page
5. "variation" means similar but not identical pattern observed
6. Evidence must cite specific locations on the page

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no other text.

ROOM LABELS VALIDATION (Phase 3.3) — MANDATORY

If this page visibly contains room labels (text inside rooms, such as room names and/or room numbers):
- AND the provisional guide contains NO rules describing room_name, room_number, or room label pairing
- THEN you MUST:
  1. Add a new_observation describing the room label pattern you see
  2. Include a suggested_rule for the missing room label convention
  3. Set overall_consistency to "inconsistent" to signal the guide is incomplete for room extraction
