Produce a final visual guide from the validated data.

PROVISIONAL GUIDE:
{provisional_guide}

STABILITY REPORT:
{stability_report}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Include ONLY rules marked as STABLE
2. Format each rule clearly with:
   - Rule ID
   - Description
   - When it applies
   - Visual examples/evidence
3. Document any PARTIAL rules as "Additional observations (not validated)"
4. List all EXCLUDED rules and why
5. State the overall guide confidence level

If the stability report shows fewer than {min_stable_ratio}% stable rules:
- DO NOT produce a guide
- Instead, explain what additional pages or information would be needed
- Return a structured rejection with specific recommendations

Format the final guide for practical use by analysts reviewing other pages of this project.
