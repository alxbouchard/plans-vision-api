Analyze the following validation data and assess rule stability.

PROVISIONAL GUIDE:
{provisional_guide}

VALIDATION REPORTS FROM PAGES:
{validation_reports}

For each rule, calculate:
1. Pages where rule was testable
2. Pages where rule was confirmed
3. Pages where rule was contradicted
4. Pages with variations

Classify each rule as STABLE, PARTIAL, or UNSTABLE.

Provide:
- Stability score per rule (0.0 to 1.0)
- Overall guide stability (ratio of stable rules)
- Specific recommendations for each unstable rule
- Assessment of whether a final guide can be generated

Be explicit about any rules that MUST be excluded from the final guide.
