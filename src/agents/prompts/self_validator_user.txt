Analyze the validation data and assess rule stability.

PROVISIONAL GUIDE:
{provisional_guide}

VALIDATION REPORTS FROM PAGES:
{validation_reports}

You MUST respond with a valid JSON object following this exact structure:

```json
{
  "total_rules": 5,
  "rule_assessments": [
    {
      "rule_id": "RULE_001",
      "classification": "stable | partial | unstable",
      "pages_testable": 3,
      "pages_confirmed": 3,
      "pages_contradicted": 0,
      "pages_variation": 0,
      "confidence_score": 0.95,
      "recommendation": "include | exclude | needs_more_data"
    }
  ],
  "stable_count": 3,
  "partial_count": 1,
  "unstable_count": 1,
  "overall_stability_ratio": 0.6,
  "can_generate_guide": true,
  "rejection_reason": null
}
```

CLASSIFICATION RULES - NO AMBIGUITY ALLOWED:
- STABLE: Confirmed on 80%+ of testable pages AND zero contradictions
- PARTIAL: Confirmed on 50-79% of testable pages, OR has variations but no contradictions
- UNSTABLE: ANY contradiction on ANY page, OR confirmed on <50% of testable pages

CRITICAL:
1. Every rule MUST be classified as exactly one of: stable, partial, unstable
2. A single contradiction makes a rule UNSTABLE - no exceptions
3. "can_generate_guide" is true ONLY if stable_count / total_rules >= 0.6
4. If can_generate_guide is false, rejection_reason MUST explain why
5. recommendation must be: "include" for stable, "exclude" for unstable, "needs_more_data" for partial

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no other text.
