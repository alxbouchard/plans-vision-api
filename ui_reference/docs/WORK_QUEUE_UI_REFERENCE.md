# WORK_QUEUE — UI Reference Demo

Allowed autonomous tasks for this UI.

1 Update test-ui.html to support PDF-first flow
2 Add panels for v1 v2 v3 endpoints
3 Add basic overlay preview using canvas
4 Ensure auth supports X-API-Key with optional legacy X-Owner-Id
5 Ensure all manual TEST_GATES_UI_REFERENCE pass
6 Update ui_reference/README.md if behavior changes

Stop and ask if:
- any recognition logic is added to UI
- any dependency on production code is introduced
- any server side changes are required to make the demo work
